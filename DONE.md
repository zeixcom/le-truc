# DONE

Done-and-reviewed tasks since the last release, compacted per the 3-file mini-kanban (owner,
2026-09-18). Each entry keeps only what is still load-bearing: rulings recorded nowhere else,
live handoffs into open tasks (referenced by LT-ID), and the changed-artifact facts Changelog
Keeper needs at release planning. Verification transcripts, changed-file line inventories and
review narratives are dropped — the full record stays in `git log -p`. Entries still carrying
`— done, pending review ⏳` are finished but not yet reviewed; their review pass happens in a
future iteration. At release planning Changelog Keeper consumes this file alongside
`CHANGELOG.md [Unreleased]`; the Architect then prunes entries whose context no live task needs.

Pruned 2026-10-02, fifth pass (Architect, after the "consolidate the compiler, then land the
pre-publish reshapes" iteration closed; Changelog Keeper recorded it in `CHANGELOG.md
[Unreleased]` the same day, deliberately omitting the byte-identical internal refactors).
Consumed: LT-227–LT-232, LT-234, LT-243–LT-245, LT-248, LT-268, LT-274–LT-276, LT-287–LT-289,
LT-304, LT-306, LT-358–LT-361, LT-364, LT-366–LT-368, LT-379, LT-380, LT-382–LT-386, LT-388,
LT-389, LT-394–LT-404, LT-406. Where their rulings live: ADR 0033 (s1–s10, the scoped emission
and the parse), ADR 0037 (amended by LT-388), ADR 0040 (s2, s4, s5), ADR 0043, ADR 0045, ADR
0032 s0/s4 and ADR 0038 s2 (LT-243's runtime-neutrality ruling), `walk.ts`'s module doc (LT-230's
`@pending` policy), and the notes below. Open handoffs are restated in their own entries:
LT-247, LT-254, LT-334, LT-335, LT-363, LT-369, LT-370, LT-378, LT-381, LT-387, LT-390–LT-393,
LT-405, LT-407, LT-408 (via LT-409). Earlier prunes: 2026-10-01, 2026-09-25 ×3, 2026-09-21 ×2.

**Rulings carried from the 2026-10-02 prune** (recorded nowhere else; do not re-litigate):
- **The scope analysis stays in-house** (LT-231). `@typescript-eslint/scope-manager` cannot scope
  the `.tsrx` AST's non-ESTree nodes (`JSXCodeBlock` and its `render` slot). Do not re-propose it
  without a `.tsrx` story.
- **Three "can this read run" predicates stay apart deliberately** (LT-231): `reactivity.ts`'s
  classifier (reactive vs static), `harvest.ts`'s portable-seed allowlist (can the browser re-run
  the initializer), and the `.tsrx` in-template client-stmt allowlist. LT-373 centralizes the
  first; merging the others is LT-369's question, not a by-product.
- **Pass contracts are structural, not branded** (LT-289): a test may hand-build an empty
  `LoopPlans`. `runEffects`'s unread `_harvests` parameter witnesses pass order (query order is the
  byte-stable contract); if effects ever reads it, drop the underscore, keep the parameter.
- **`commonIndent`'s `skipDocContinuations` option stays** (LT-234): unifying the twins would move
  bytes for no benefit.
- **A duplicated `expose()` key is last-wins**, as at runtime (LT-288).
- **A hand-spliced Parser seed goes through `attrValue`** — the serialized attribute, not the
  expression's value (LT-386). The bare `() => host.<prop>` mirror for lazy text sites still splices
  the raw attribute expression on purpose: string/number parsers agree, only `asJSON` object values
  diverge pre-connect. Widening is demand-gated.
- **LTC065 is one code with two faces** (LT-394): the same tier and decision for the author.
  `@position-try` is deliberately absent from `DESCRIPTOR_ATRULES`, since its block holds properties.
- **Distributing `:is(:host …)` gives each member its own specificity** (LT-398), accepted because
  the members come from one authored list.
- **LTC051 reports one drift at a time** (LT-403): when sheets drift, boundary-only differences are
  named once the sheets match.
- **Corpus CSS fixes taken under LT-397** (input for LT-409): module-codeblock's `pre`/`code` rules
  are a top-level `:global { … }` block, and their leak into nested instances is accepted;
  colorinfo's `dt`/`dd` nest under `dl` (R1).
- **Docs-server routing is ours, not Bun's** (LT-364): first-differing segment kind wins
  (static > `:param` > `*`), params are `decodeURIComponent`-ed (a malformed escape is a 404), and
  traversal tests use an encoded slash (`..%2f`), since WHATWG URL parsing normalizes `%2e%2e`.
- **No `errors.md` row yet for `LTC071`, nor the widened `LTC051`** (LT-402's handoff to the
  owner's `.agents/` pass). Tracked as LT-410.

**Open obligations** (not yet discharged; check before closing the named work):
- **Track the lightningcss upstream issues #1081 and #1065.** `css-scope.ts` does string-level
  selector surgery over a read-only parse to avoid them; keep the `lightningcss-wasm` and
  `lightningcss-cli` pins on one version (ADR 0033 s9). Retire the surgery when both are fixed (LT-304).
- **Sandbox-blocked legs the owner reruns outside the sandbox:** `check:sim`'s Deno leg (LT-289),
  `check:portability`'s bun leg (LT-366, LT-230), and the `examples/test/scoping` Playwright run in
  both `cssTargets` modes, Chromium and WebKit, if LT-397's corpus run did not include it (LT-401).
- ~~**Upstream issues for the MF1 → MF2 converter are the owner's call.**~~ Discharged
  2026-10-01: tracker searched (no prior or similar reports), both filed by the owner as
  [messageformat#472](https://github.com/messageformat/messageformat/issues/472) (duplicate
  `.input` → `dedupeInputs`) and [#473](https://github.com/messageformat/messageformat/issues/473)
  (non-string skeleton literals → `stringifyLiterals`); still unfixed at 0.12.0. Compacted
  references live in `MF2_EXIT.md`; the pinned test flags an upstream fix — delete the matching
  normalization then (LT-253).
- **Browser specs the agent sandbox could not run:** `basic-pluralize.spec.ts`,
  `module-todo.spec.ts` and `form-tokenbox.spec.ts`, in en and de. The owner confirms they are
  green before the next PR (LT-252, LT-354).
- **The first `@empty` over a reactive List owes a browser spec leg** for the empty → filled →
  empty cycle. No corpus component uses it yet (LT-212).
- **CI has not yet proved the variant spec matrix.** CI triggers only on `main`/`next` pushes and
  PRs, not `v3`, so the next PR's run is the first proof. It must list every variant set, and a
  throwaway broken `.ts` twin must fail the job on surface "ts" (LT-295).
- **The simulation realm's timer ownership is process-wide.** Any host timer scheduled while a
  realm is open is cancelled at `dispose()`. That is safe only because `simulateCorpus()` runs in
  one-shot builds. A task that opens a realm in a long-lived process (dev server, watch
  rebuilds) must revisit it (LT-207).
- **The trap in `src/tests/reactive.test.ts`:** one assertion passes under both the pre- and
  post-LT-178 spelling. Tighten it once LT-189 item 11 settles the wording (LT-179).

**Standing notes for compiler-adjacent tasks:**
- **Shared compiler code never spells a surface's construct** (LT-233). It reads
  `wordingOf(ctx | component)` from `surface.ts`. `ComponentIR.surface` is optional, and absent
  means `.tsx` wording, because a required field would tighten contract IR. Diagnostic parity has
  two standing checks: equal code, severity and message after the allowlist, and a leak scan for
  `.tsrx` vocabulary in `.tsx` messages (LT-242).
- **"Server-only" is positive** (LT-348, LT-349). A name is server-only iff the server render
  binds it and no author-declared client binding rebinds it. Compiler-generated query locals never
  rebind. A tier never licenses an unbound client name. An undeclared name belongs to tsc, not
  LTC005. Setup consts and imports stay rejected in list bodies, because
  `computeClientNeededNames` walks no list-body position. Widening that walk is the fix if a
  component needs it.
- **The host profile's `JSX.LibraryManagedAttributes` distributes over unions** (LT-343). A
  plain `Omit` flattens a discriminated args type and drops its requirements. A union parameter
  type opts out of inline-literal type reading (`infer-type.ts`), so check the generated modules
  before spreading the pattern.
- **`| undefined` on an intrinsic attribute only where it literally means "absent when
  omitted"** (LT-308): component-tag config attributes that mirror an optional arg. Never ARIA or
  global attributes.
- **LTC055's refusals are what `Intl` cannot run** (LT-250): custom formatters, ICU number/date
  patterns, `precision-increment`, one argument as both number and date. `date`/`time` apply
  the record's `timeZone`, which diverges from `@messageformat/core` on purpose. The call-site
  check does not track shadowing.
- **`truc:html` fails closed on both halves; configure once per realm** (LT-138). The build and
  the browser are separate module instances. Pruning plural arms for a connect-time prop is
  declined, because the prop stays writable (LT-252).
- A compiler crash during a corpus build makes `typecheck`'s `&&`-chained `tsc` silently skip.
  Check the exit code, never grep for "error TS" (LT-226). A handoff's `check:corpus` claim is its
  **exit code**, not the warning baseline (LT-283).
- **A folded reactive thunk that reads page context is an error, not an omission** (LT-258).
  `Date.now()` is unresolvable in every tier; a page-context read is realm-answerable, so omitting
  it would silently re-route Folded → Simulated and out of template emission. The page-context
  side is the deny-list `PAGE_CONTEXT_GLOBALS` (`fold-inputs.ts`); the positive side is
  `assertFoldScopeClosed`. Keep that split. RNG stays on the impure-ambient side, and computed or
  aliased receivers (`crypto['randomUUID']()`, a destructured `randomUUID`) still fold as accepted
  residue, to revisit only on a real case (LT-314; LT-340 is the related indirection gap).
- **Client-only signal credit** means "at least one client-only read, none a render read" (not
  "every consumer client-only"), and the render read is transitive through setup consts
  (LT-323, LT-327). LT-333 extends it.
- **Harness-name aliasing covers only emitter-synthesized sites** (LT-302). Authored text keeps its
  spelling, and `host`/`internals` are never aliased.
- **`truc:pass` addressing** (LT-338, LT-319, LT-339). An auto-addressed site is a **required**
  query (`'one'`), the same as a raw custom element. A shared-class group lowers to one
  `pass(all(…))` only on **textual** identity of the `truc:pass` objects, never semantic
  equivalence, and only when every member would reach the fallback itself. The imperative
  `pass(all(…))` stays sanctioned as a client-only setup statement (tier 2).
- **A loop is diagnosed only when its output IS a branch root** (LT-301). A loop wrapped in an
  element inside a branch stays legal. Branch-scoped `each()` is a design task when a migration
  first needs it.
- **`<truc:try>`** (LT-303): `tsc` owns the arm types, the repeated arm and the missing `catch`.
  The compiler keeps one LTC005 shape error and also guards the missing `catch`, because it never
  runs `tsc`. As a `.map()` output root it is LTC053, matching `.tsrx`. LT-276 reshapes the `try`
  node under both front ends.
- **Generated typings** (LT-312, LT-325). Import keys are the shortest path suffix no other
  source shares, so a collision fails loudly. The file is always written, even empty. A
  `.tsx`-served tag gets no generated tag-map entry, because its authored source carries one and
  a second would be TS 2717. The examples typecheck leg needs a corpus build first.
- **The canonical output directory is not pruned** (LT-296). The route serves a canonical client
  only when `registry.json` selects that surface; `compileCorpus` owns and prunes only
  `variants/`.
- **The simulation realm** (LT-188, LT-332). A Folded/Static child in the composed closure runs
  its connect in the realm, and its diagnostics attribute to the rendering parent, which is
  intended. A connect-time page-context API the realm lacks (`history`, `requestAnimationFrame`)
  gets an **inert stub** in `patch-table.ts`/`capabilities.ts`, not a standing classification.
- **Dynamic tags** (LT-213, for the future `<truc:element tag={…}>`, ADR 0041). Address such an
  element by class/id/`data-*`, never by tag. No React-style `const Tag = …; <Tag>`, which
  collides with PascalCase compose dispatch. IR shape:
  `tag: { kind: 'static', name } | { kind: 'server', exprText }`.
- **`argsFromAttrs`** (LT-290, LT-095). Declaring a ref stub inside the page-occurrence helper
  was rejected, because a `refStub` value would reach the markup. A server arg's page-occurrence
  attribute is its **kebab-case** name; a `number` arg has a numeric channel (blank = absent,
  non-numeric = unrenderable). LT-297 and LT-336 continue this.
- **The size bet holds on the runtime, not the payload** (LT-266): 8.72 vs 64.38 kB gzip runtime;
  the payload line (3.07 vs 8.54) favours React. Any connector claim quotes **both** lines. Run of
  record: `spike/size-bet/FINDING.md`.

**Standing notes for wave-4 migrations:**
- **Don't contort a component to dodge a classifier gap; file the gap** (LT-103). Record tier and
  reason as they land. Tier predictions are often wrong: refs used only in `watch`/`on` never route
  (LT-096).
- **`bun run build:docs` is part of every migration's check** (LT-095): it caught a demo
  regression nothing else ran.
- **A Parser-exposed prop's text site is a `{() => host.<prop>}` thunk**, not the arg (LT-099).
- **A client that writes a style or ARIA value at connect gets a server render in the exact form
  the watcher writes**, so the connect diff is empty (LT-102).
- **A compose site cannot put attributes on the child's inner element**, so an opener needing
  `aria-haspopup` renders as a raw `<button>` (LT-101). The dialog's `body.scroll-lock` waits for
  LT-306's `:global()`.
- **A raw dashed tag seeds a child import only when a query addresses it** (LT-291).
- **A provider's context keys live in a module with no side effects**, never in the component
  module, because importing a component module defines the element (LT-106; docs in LT-189
  item 14).
- **Lazyload keeps its hand-written `watch(content, { ok, nil, stale, err })`**. The compiled
  boundary cannot express that contract until LT-334 (LT-104).
- **No compiler-stamped hash class for addressing** (LT-096): page-authored occurrences never pass
  through the compiler's render, so a stamped hook would be absent where the enhancer binds. The
  `:not(<tag> *)` exclusion is accepted; its only miss is an own element inside a same-tag
  ancestor of the host, which no composition produces.
- **Scrollarea's wall time at demo scale is noise** (LT-103).
