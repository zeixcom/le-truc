 * deriving it from that constant. The retry fires *after* the
 * dependency-resolution window closes, so a provider whose own
 * `provideContexts` listener activated late (it waited on
 * `customElements.whenDefined()` for a slow child) still catches the retry.
 * If this dropped below `DEPENDENCY_TIMEOUT`, late providers would be missed
 * and consumers would permanently lock in their fallback (see ADR-0015).
 * The 10 ms margin covers event-loop scheduling jitter between the dependency
 * timeout firing and the provider's listener activating.
